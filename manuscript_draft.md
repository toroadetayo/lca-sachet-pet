# Manuscript draft: LCA of Sachet vs PET Bottled Water — Lagos, Nigeria

## Title
Cradle-to-Grave Life Cycle Assessment of Sachet and PET Bottled Drinking Water in Lagos, Nigeria

## Abstract (draft)
Sachet water is widely consumed in West Africa yet its lifecycle environmental impacts are poorly quantified. This study provides a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) comparing sachet water and PET bottled water for Lagos, Nigeria, focusing on global warming potential (GWP), water depletion, and cumulative energy demand. Using open-source LCI proxies, field-relevant inventory assumptions, and uncertainty/sensitivity analyses, we identify packaging production and end-of-life management as primary hotspots and evaluate mitigation scenarios including increased recycling and lightweight packaging.

## Introduction
- Background on sachet water prevalence and policy relevance in Nigeria
- Aim and research questions

## Methods
- Goal and scope (functional unit: 1 L consumed at point of use)
- System boundaries and allocation choices
- Inventory sources and data quality
- Impact assessment methods (GWP100, water depletion, cumulative energy)

## Results (to be filled with figures/tables)
- Deterministic results: GWP, water, energy per FU
- Monte Carlo uncertainty results
- Sensitivity scenarios

## Discussion
- Interpretation of hotspots
- Policy implications for Lagos and Nigeria
- Limitations and future data needs

## Conclusions and recommendations
