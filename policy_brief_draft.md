# Policy Brief Draft — Sachet and PET Bottled Water (Lagos)

## Key message
Reducing packaging mass and improving collection and recycling systems yield the largest reductions in water depletion, energy use, and GWP for packaged drinking water in Lagos.

## Quick stats (baseline per 1 L)
- Sachet: GWP ≈ 0.0425 kg CO2-eq; water ≈ 12.4 L; energy ≈ 0.592 MJ.
- PET: GWP ≈ 0.0897 kg CO2-eq; water ≈ 82.6 L; energy ≈ 1.912 MJ.

## Recommended actions for policymakers
1. Prioritise collection and mechanical recycling infrastructure for PET and PE packaging.
2. Introduce lightweighting targets and material-efficiency incentives for sachet producers.
3. Pilot producer responsibility schemes for sachet producers to fund collection.
4. Fund local data collection (plant-level energy use, packaging mass, waste fate shares) to refine interventions.

## Next steps
- Stakeholder workshop with Lagos environmental and water agencies, sachet producers, and informal waste sector to co-design interventions.
