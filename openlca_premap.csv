polyethylene film,g,6,"polyethylene film production" ,ELCD,"Polyethylene film production, packaging grade","<paste nexus id>",Look for PE film or low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film processes
polyethylene terephthalate,g,24,"polyethylene terephthalate (PET) granulate production",ELCD,"PET granulate production","<paste nexus id>",Or use PET bottle production process if available (adjust mass)
clean water,L,1.0,"tap water, average, supply" ,ELCD,"Water, treated, distribution to tap","<paste nexus id>",If no Nigeria grid, use regional proxy and document
electricity,kWh,0.02,"electricity, grid mix, Nigeria OR West Africa proxy",ELCD,"Electricity, medium voltage, consumption, country proxy","<paste nexus id>",Use closest country or regional grid mix available
truck transport,tkm,0.04,"transport, freight, road, lorry 16-32 t" ,ELCD,"Transport, freight, lorry >16t, EUROPE/GENERIC","<paste nexus id>",Convert mass (kg→t) and multiply by km to get tkm; adjust if Nigeria-specific transport exists
disposal landfill,g,1.20,"disposal, landfill" ,ELCD,"Disposal, landfill, municipal waste","<paste nexus id>",Choose unmanaged/controlled landfill depending on LAWMA context
open burn,g,4.50,"open burning of waste" ,ELCD,"Open burning of waste (uncontrolled)","<paste nexus id>",Open-burning processes have high uncertainty; document assumptions
