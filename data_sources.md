Recommended data sources and literature (starter list)

Open LCI databases (open)
- OpenLCA Nexus: ELCD (European reference life-cycle data), USLCI — use these for background processes where local data are unavailable.
- Open data: OpenLCA Nexus datasets and other freely available LCI collections.

Global databases (note access restrictions)
- Ecoinvent: comprehensive but paid; usable if you have access. If not, use ELCD/USLCI and document adaptations.

Regional & country sources (Nigeria / West Africa)
- Government reports (Nigeria Bureau of Statistics, Ministry of Water Resources) for water supply and waste statistics.
- World Bank / UN-Habitat / UNEP country reports on solid waste management and water access.
- NGO & academic studies on sachet water and plastic waste in Nigeria (search Web of Science/Google Scholar for "sachet water Nigeria life cycle", "sachet water Lagos", "plastic waste Lagos").

Suggested literature search terms
- "sachet water Nigeria", "sachet water Lagos", "plastic sachet life cycle", "packaging life cycle Nigeria", "waste management Lagos".

Field data you may collect (high priority)
- Sachet mass (g) and material type
- Typical sachet sizes (mL) and market share
- Filling plant energy intensity per L
- Transport distances and vehicle types
- End-of-life fate shares (percentages for recycling, landfill, burning, litter)

Notes
- I will compile numeric parameter suggestions from open literature and document sources. If you have local measurements, provide them and I'll use them as primary data.
